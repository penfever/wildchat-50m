<p>I made a few minor changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Capitalized "Mido" as it appears to be a proper noun (a person's name)</li>
<li>Added "which means" to improve sentence flow</li>
<li>Changed "other programs" to "other similar software" for more precision</li>
<li>Changed "appreciate" to "like" in the last sentence, as "like" is a more common verb to use in this context.</li>
