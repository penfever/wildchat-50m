cut from that to make viral shorts of 40-50 sec "Now we come to the last chapter<br />
of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, which is very important in Sikh History. So, Guru Sahib<br />
was established in Anandpur. He became very powerful. He could not compete with<br />
them. There were many battles with the mountain kings. They tried very hard to<br />
remove them from Anandpur. But they remained strong and established in Anandpur.<br />
All these kingdoms were under the Mughal throne. So they thought that we cannot<br />
do anything ourselves. We ask for help from the king. So they wrote a letter to<br />
Aurangzeb. In the letter, it is written that the government has put us in a very<br />
big trouble. The Guru Tegh Bahadur of the Sikhs, whose head you had cut, you had<br />
done very well by cutting, his son has become very powerful now.<br />
And he has sworn that he will definitely take revenge on his father. He has<br />
become very powerful. We have heard that maybe he will reach Delhi. So you<br />
should do something. Before the problem gets worse, you should do something. So<br />
Aurangzeb read the letter and Aurangzeb sent a message to Nawab Wazir Khan. So<br />
at that time, there were two big cities or provinces in Punjab. Lahore was the<br />
largest and after that was Sarand. So the governor of Sarand was Wazir Khan. So<br />
Aurangzeb said to Wazir Khan that you have to help all these mountain kings. and<br />
you have to remove the Guru from Anandpur. So, a great siege started. Anandpur<br />
was surrounded. No one could come inside, no one could go outside. It started to<br />
become a mess.<br />
But the fort was very strong. Nothing affected it. When a long time passed, the<br />
grains started to finish inside. So, people became&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Option 1: The Warning to Aurangzeb</strong><br />
(0s-45s)<br />
"Now we come to the last chapter of Guru Gobind Singh Ji... The mountain kings<br />
wrote a letter to Aurangzeb, warning him that Guru Gobind Singh's son has become<br />
powerful and seeks revenge for his father's death. They fear he may reach Delhi.<br />
Aurangzeb takes notice and sends a message to Nawab Wazir Khan to help the<br />
mountain kings and remove the Guru from Anandpur."</p>

<p><strong>Option 2: The Siege of Anandpur</strong><br />
(0s-50s)<br />
"Guru Gobind Singh Ji established in Anandpur, became very powerful. The<br />
mountain kings tried to remove him, but he remained strong. They asked for help<br />
from Aurangzeb, who sent a message to Nawab Wazir Khan to siege Anandpur. The<br />
city was surrounded, no one could come in or out. The fort was strong, but<br />
grains started to finish, and people became desperate."</p>

<p><strong>Option 3: The Plot Against Guru Gobind Singh</strong><br />
(0s-45s)<br />
"The mountain kings, under the Mughal throne, couldn't compete with Guru Gobind<br />
Singh's power. They wrote to Aurangzeb, saying his father's death has made him<br />
seek revenge. Aurangzeb responds by ordering Nawab Wazir Khan to help the<br />
mountain kings and capture the Guru. A great siege begins, and Anandpur is<br />
surrounded. The fate of the Guru and his people hangs in the balance."</p>

<p>"They were given a promise that nothing will happen to them if they come out of<br />
the fort. But as soon as they came out, Sher Mohammad Khan and his army attacked<br />
them. It was a fierce battle, the small group of Sikhs fought bravely but they<br />
were vastly outnumbered. Then, the two elder sons of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, Ajit<br />
Singh and Jujhar Singh, came forward to fight. They were just 18 and 14 years<br />
old respectively, but they fought like lions. When Ajit Singh's arrow killed the<br />
enemy, his father was proud and said, 'Well done, my son!' But soon, both the<br />

<hr />

<p>"Guru Gobind Singh Ji, after the death of his two sons, his youngest sons, at<br />
such a young age, when they are taken away, no one can even imagine the amount<br />
of pain he must be feeling. He is not crying, not showing any weakness, but he<br />
is giving strength to the rest of the Sikhs. When your own children are being<br />
taken away in front of your eyes, at such a young age, the pain is unbearable.<br />
The youngest son, Fateh Singh, who is just 5 years old, and his brother Zorawar<br />
Singh, who is 7 years old, are about to be taken away. They are being asked to<br />
convert to Islam, and if they don't, they will be killed. Guru Gobind Singh Ji<br />
knows this, and he sends a person to tell them to be brave and not to convert."</p>

cut from that to make viral shorts of 40-50 sec "Now we come to the last chapter<br />
of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, which is very important in Sikh History. So, Guru Sahib<br />
was established in Anandpur. He became very powerful. He could not compete with<br />
them. There were many battles with the mountain kings. They tried very hard to<br />
remove them from Anandpur. But they remained strong and established in Anandpur.<br />
All these kingdoms were under the Mughal throne. So they thought that we cannot<br />
do anything ourselves. We ask for help from the king. So they wrote a letter to<br />
Aurangzeb. In the letter, it is written that the government has put us in a very<br />
big trouble. The Guru Tegh Bahadur of the Sikhs, whose head you had cut, you had<br />
done very well by cutting, his son has become very powerful now.<br />
And he has sworn that he will definitely take revenge on his father. He has<br />
become very powerful. We have heard that maybe he will reach Delhi. So you<br />
should do something. Before the problem gets worse, you should do something. So<br />
Aurangzeb read the letter and Aurangzeb sent a message to Nawab Wazir Khan. So<br />
at that time, there were two big cities or provinces in Punjab. Lahore was the<br />
largest and after that was Sarand. So the governor of Sarand was Wazir Khan. So<br />
Aurangzeb said to Wazir Khan that you have to help all these mountain kings. and<br />
you have to remove the Guru from Anandpur. So, a great siege started. Anandpur<br />
was surrounded. No one could come inside, no one could go outside. It started to<br />
become a mess.<br />
But the fort was very strong. Nothing affected it. When a long time passed, the<br />
grains started to finish inside. So, people became very sad because there were<br />
not only soldiers inside. There were ordinary people, children, women. So some<br />
Sikhs went and told Guru Sahib that we will leave the fort, or else we will die<br />
of hunger. So Guru Sahib said, have some patience. But when the Sikhs,<br />
especially the children, saw that they were hungry, they could not bear it. And<br />
finally Guru Sahib gave permission that we will leave the fort. So in return,<br />
the mountain kings and the Mughal government, they said, you just leave the<br />
fort. No one will have hair on their head. No one will be able to do anything.<br />
The Qur'an has been promised. So Guru Sahib took all his Sikhs and came out of<br />
Anandpur. They had gone a little far that the combined army of Pahadi Raja and<br />
the Mughal army fell on them. On the children too? Yes, the children ran away<br />
but they fell on the army. Everything happened here and there. Guru Sahib's two<br />
small children, his mother Mata Gujri, They also disappeared somewhere. And this<br />
happened outside Anandpur, on the banks of the Sarsa river. So some Sikhs stayed<br />
there and they fought a big army. And Guru Gobind Singh ji took his two elder<br />
brothers, Ajit Singh and Jujhar Singh, there was a small fort there, not a fort<br />
but a small fort. Guru Sahib took care of us. Sorry, I broke the flow of your<br />
podcast.<br />
But I just want to say, firstly, thank you for supporting us throughout the<br />
years. Secondly, we have started a new initiative, which is Beer by Self Skill<br />
House. Its intention is that in India's upskilling journey, we should contribute<br />
a little. We have brought a commercial editing course for you. Because this is<br />
the core skill set of the Beer by Self team. A lot of upskilling courses are<br />
coming. So at least check out Beer by Self Skill House. Follow our YouTube<br />
channel. Follow our Instagram page. But for now, enjoy this episode of TRS. So<br />
what happened in Chamkaur's time? There are historical accounts about it. There<br />
are more accounts. But the most compelling and good account that I found was a<br />
Muslim poet, Allah Yarkhan Jogi.<br />
He has written a Marsiya whose title is Ganje Shaheeda. Marsiya is a... the<br />
story of someone's death, the story of grief, is called Marsiya. So he has<br />
written Marsiya. I will read a few lines of Marsiya and then I will tell you the<br />
story of Chamkaur. The day when the lions were taken down in Chamkaur, they were<br />
all burning, they were all burning, they were all burning, they were all<br />
burning, they were all burning, they were all burning, they were all burning,<br />
they were all burning, gusse se nazar jaati thi afwaj-e&lt;|im_end|&gt;</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> "Now we come to the last chapter of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, a<br />
pivotal moment in Sikh history. Guru Sahib was firmly established in Anandpur,<br />
growing in strength and influence. However, this drew the ire of the mountain<br />
kings and the Mughal Empire. In a desperate move, they wrote to Aurangzeb,<br />
pleading for help to remove Guru Gobind Singh from Anandpur. The letter stated,<br />
'The son of Guru Tegh Bahadur has vowed revenge and is growing powerful. He<br />
might even reach Delhi. You must act before it's too late.' Aurangzeb responded<br />
by ordering Nawab Wazir Khan to besiege Anandpur. The siege was brutal; no one<br />
could enter or leave. As food supplies dwindled, the situation inside the fort<br />
became dire. Guru Sahib's resolve was tested. Finally, with the promise of safe<br />
passage, Guru Gobind Singh Ji and his Sikhs left Anandpur. However, the promise<br />
was betrayed. The combined Pahadi Raja and Mughal forces attacked, leading to a<br />
tragic battle on the banks of the Sarsa river. Guru Sahib's two young sons and<br />
his mother, Mata Gujri, were among those who disappeared in the chaos."</p>
