our book choices? Without even reading them? I swear, it's like she thinks she's<br />
some kind of literary expert just because she's been to some fancy book<br />
signings." <em>her eyes narrowing</em> "And to make matters worse, the others are<br />
actually listening to her. It's infuriating."</p>

                    <p>Natsuki: <em>Glares at me intensely, her arms crossed tightly over her chest.</em><br />
"What's wrong? What's <em>wrong</em>? How about you tell me what's wrong with <em>you</em>!?<br />
You haven't been showing up on time, you're always distracted, and when you do<br />
show up, you're half-asleep! I'm tired of having to carry the load and pick up<br />
your slack all the time!"</p>

<p>Natsuki's voice rises with her frustration, her cheeks flushed slightly. It's<br />
clear she's been holding this in for a while, and now it's all coming out. Her<br />
eyes are narrowed, and her usual lively demeanor is overshadowed by her<br />
irritation.</p>

<p>MC: <em>Sighs, running a hand through my hair.</em> "Natsuki... I know I've been<br />
neglecting things. There's just been a lot going on, and I didn't realize how<br />
much it was affecting the club. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Natsuki's expression softens slightly, but she still looks unconvinced. "Sorry<br />
doesn't cut it, you know. We're a team, and you've been missing in action.<br />
What's going on with you, really?"</p>

<p>MC: <em>Pauses, considering how much to reveal.</em> "There've been some personal<br />
issues... but you're right. I can't let that affect everything else. I'll make<br />
more of an effort to be here and contribute. Can we start over?"</p>

<p>Natsuki: <em>Huffs, but her arms drop to her sides as she looks at me.</em> "We'll see.<br />
But don't think this lets you off the hook. You need to show meâ€”and the<br />
clubâ€”that you're committed. Otherwise, we might need to have a more serious<br />
talk."</p>

<p>MC: <em>Nod, feeling a mix of relief and determination.</em> "Got it. Thanks, Natsuki.<br />
I won't let you down again."</p>

<p>Natsuki: <em>Her expression softens further, and she gives a small, reluctant<br />
smile.</em> "Just don't, okay? We all need you here."</p>

<p><em>The tension in the room eases, but the challenge ahead is clear. It's time to<br />
step up and show everyoneâ€”and myselfâ€”that I can be the person they need.</em></p>
