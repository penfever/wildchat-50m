<p>While it's great that you're enthusiastic and willing to take a chance, the tone<br />
of this email comes across as a bit too casual and uncertain. Here's why:</p>

<ol>
<li>"I don't know if you're hiring" - This phrase can make it seem like you haven't done your research or taken the time to understand the company's current needs.</li>
<li>"Wasn't sure if you're the correct person" - This suggests that you haven't<br />
taken the time to find the right contact or do your due diligence on the<br />
company.</li>
<li>"Facebooker" - This is not a word, and it's likely you meant to say<br />
"Facebook" or "I saw your company on Facebook."</li>
<li>"Figured what the heck" - This phrase is too casual and informal for a job<br />
application email. It can come across as unprofessional and lacking in<br />
seriousness.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a suggested rewrite:</p>

<p>"Dear [Hiring Manager's Name],</p>

<p>I came across [Company Name] on Facebook and was impressed by the work you do.<br />
I'm excited to learn more about potential opportunities at your company.<br />
Although I couldn't find any current job postings, I wanted to reach out and<br />
express my interest in exploring possible roles that may be available.</p>

<p>I've attached my resume for your review. If you're not the right person to<br />
contact, please let me know who I should reach out to. I'm looking forward to<br />
the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.</p>

another attempt at a more casual and concise version:</p>

<p>"Hi, I saw your company on Facebook and thought I'd send over my resume. Not<br />
sure if you're hiring, but figured it was worth a shot. Thanks for your time."</p>

<p>This one is even more straightforward and to the point, and has a bit of a<br />
casual tone. If this isn't it either, please give me some hints about your<br />
style, like what kind of tone you're aiming for (e.g. funny, professional,<br />
enthusiastic) and what kind of language you typically use (e.g. slang, jargon,<br />
straightforward). I'll try to help you craft a message that sounds more like<br />
something you'd write.</p>

                    <p>Your original message sounds very casual and informal, almost like a text to a<br />
friend. It's a bit unpolished and has some grammatical errors (e.g. "you're"<br />
should be "you're" is correct, but "your" should be "you're" in this context;<br />
"facebooker" isn't a word, it's probably meant to be "Facebook"). The tone is<br />
fairly laid-back and doesn't sound very professional.</p>

<p>If you want to keep the casual tone but still be clear and correct, you could<br />
try something like:</p>

<p>"Hi, I'm not sure if you're hiring right now, or if you're the right person to<br />
contact, but I saw your post on Facebook and thought I'd reach out. Here's my<br />
resume, just in case."</p>

<p>Hi [Recipient's Name],</p>

<p>I saw your post on Facebook and thought it would be worth reaching out to see if<br />
you're hiring. Iâ€™m not sure if youâ€™re the right person to contact, but figured<br />
what the heck, itâ€™s worth a shot.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve attached my resume if youâ€™re interested. Thanks for considering!</p>

<p>Best,<br />
[Your Name]<br />

                    <p>Your original message is quite casual and conveys your enthusiasm, but it has a<br />
few grammatical errors and could use a bit of smoothing out. Hereâ€™s a revised<br />
version with correct grammar and a bit more clarity:</p>

<hr />

<p>I donâ€™t know if youâ€™re hiring at this time, and wasnâ€™t sure if youâ€™re the<br />
correct person for sending a resume, but I saw it on Facebook and figured, "What<br />
the heck."</p>

<hr />

<p>Changes made:<br />
1. "you're" is the correct contraction for "you are."<br />
2. "Facebook" is the correct spelling.<br />
3. Added a comma before "but" for better flow.<br />
4. "What the heck" is placed in quotation marks for clarity.</p>

<p>This version maintains the casual tone while being grammatically correct.</p>
