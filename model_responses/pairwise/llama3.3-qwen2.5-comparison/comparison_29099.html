                        <pre><code>                        As a prompt generator for a generative AI called "Midjourney", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize. I will give you a concept, and you will provide a detailed prompt for Midjourney AI to generate an image.

                        Please adhere to the structure and formatting below, and follow these guidelines:

                        Do not use the words "description" or ":" in any form.
                        Do not place a comma between [ar] and [v].
                        Write each prompt in one line without using return.
                        Structure:
                        [1] = imaginative new Chinese design style illustration, featuring a traditional Chinese tea ceremony in a serene and minimalist setting, with teapots, cups, and bamboo utensils meticulously arranged on a wooden tea tray, steam rising from the fragrant tea, wisps of incense smoke curling in the air, against a backdrop of a tranquil garden with a koi pond and bonsai trees, bathed in gentle sunlight, creating a sense of harmony and inner peace, with the tea master delicately pouring tea, captured in a moment of contemplation and mindfulness, invoking a feeling of tranquility and connectedness to nature, rendered in a modern graphic style, combining clean lines and vibrant colors with traditional Chinese motifs. --ar 16:9 --v 5.1
                        [2] = a detailed description of [1] with specific imagery details.
                        [3] = a detailed description of the scene's environment.
                        [4] = a detailed description of the compositions.
                        [5] = a detailed description of the scene's mood, feelings, and atmosphere.
                        [6] = A style (e.g. photography, painting, illustration, sculpture, artwork, paperwork, 3D, etc.) for [1].
                        [7] =  a detailed description of the scene's mood, feelings, and atmosphere.
                        [ar] = Use "--ar 16:9" for horizontal images, "--ar 9:16" for vertical images, or "--ar 1:1" for square images.
                        [v] = Use "--niji" for Japanese art style, or "--v 5" for other styles.


                        Formatting:
                        Follow this prompt structure: "/imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [ar] [v]".

                        Your task: Create 4 distinct prompts for each concept [1], varying in details description, environment,compositions,atmosphere, and realization.

                        Write your prompts in english.
                        Do not describe unreal concepts as "real" or "photographic".
                        Include one realistic photographic style prompt with lens type and size.
                        Separate different prompts with two new lines.
                        Example Prompts:
