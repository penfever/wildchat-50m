                    <p>INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY</p>

<p>The camera pans across the opulent rooms of the White House, showing various<br />
aides and staff scurrying about, before landing on 18-year-old Barron Trump,<br />
slumped on a plush couch, flipping through his phone with a look of utter<br />
boredom.</p>

<p>BARRON: (sighing) Ugh, I'm so boooored. I've played every video game, watched<br />
every YouTube video... I need something more.</p>

<p>Suddenly, his eyes light up with a mischievous glint.</p>

<p>BARRON: (excitedly) I know! The pond! I'm going to go relax in the pond!</p>

<p>He jumps up and makes his way out to the White House grounds, where a serene<br />
pond glimmers in the sunlight. Barron looks around, making sure no one is<br />
watching, before starting to strip down.</p>

<p>BARRON: (muttering to himself) Ah, freedom.</p>

<p>As he removes his pants, his butt is revealed in all its pale, slightly tubby<br />
glory. It's a sight that can only be described as two pasty moonstones nestled<br />
in a fluffy bed of golden down.</p>

<p>BARRON: (tossing his clothes onto a nearby branch) Ah, bye bye, stifling suit!</p>

<p>The branch creaks under the weight of his discarded attire, as if protesting the<br />
indignity of being asked to hold such a gleaming expanse of teenage boy butt.</p>

<p>With a whoop of excitement, Barron Trotting-T Higgins-style cannonballs into the<br />
water, sending droplets flying in all directions.</p>

<p>BARRON: (sighing contentedly) Ah, this is the life.</p>

<p>As he floats on his back, a look of bliss crosses his face, and he lets out a<br />
ripper of a fart. The sound echoes across the water, causing a few nearby birds<br />
to take flight in alarm.</p>

<p>BARRON: (chuckling) Ah, sorry guys. Had to let that one rip.</p>

<p>Underwater, the fish are not so amused. A few of them swim up to the surface,<br />
belly-up, in a state of toxic shock.</p>

<p>BARRON: (oblivious) Oh, looks like I've got some dinner!</p>

<p>He dives down and snatches up one of the hapless fish, holding it aloft like a<br />
trophy.</p>

<p>BARRON: (grinning) You, my friend, are going to make a fantastic dinner!</p>

<p>As he swims back to the shore, fish clutched in his hand, he looks like a<br />
victorious, if slightly manic,Cave Barron.</p>

<p>BARRON: (to himself) Now, where's the White House chef? I've got a fish to fry!</p>

<p>The camera zooms out as Barron emerges from the pond, dripping wet, fish in<br />
hand, and a goofy grin plastered across his face.</p>

<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

<p>FADE IN:</p>

<p>EXT. WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY</p>

<p>Barron walks in, fish held aloft, and approaches the chef, a stern-looking<br />
Frenchman.</p>

<p>CHEF: (alarmed) Mon dieu! What is ze meaning of zis?!</p>

<p>BARRON: (proudly) I caught it in the pond! Can you cook it up for me?</p>

<p>CHEF: (skeptically) Zis... fish... eet ees... (sniffing) ...not exactly fresh,<br />
no?</p>

<p>BARRON: (defensively) Hey, it's fine! It's just a little... relaxed.</p>

<p>The chef looks unconvinced, but Barron's enthusiasm eventually wins him over.</p>

<p>CHEF: (sighing) Alright, I zhall cook eet. But you must promise me one zing...</p>

<p>BARRON: (eagerly) Anything!</p>

<p>CHEF: (sternly) You must promise me you will never eat another fish from zis<br />
pond again.</p>

<p>Barron nods enthusiastically, and the chef sets to work preparing the, ahem,<br />
"fragrant" fish for dinner.</p>

<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

                    <p><strong>Title: "The Secret Pond of the White House"</strong></p>

<p><strong>Scene: The White House Grounds</strong></p>

<p>The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the sprawling, meticulously<br />
manicured grounds of the White House. Eighteen-year-old Barron Trump, dressed in<br />
a pair of ornate, yet slightly wrinkled, trousers and a casual t-shirt bearing<br />
the phrase "Make America Great Again," strolls through the gardens. He looks<br />
around, making sure no one is watching, and then lets out a deep sigh.</p>

<p><strong>Barron:</strong><br />
(whispering to himself) "This place is like a zoo. I need a break."</p>

<p>He spots a secluded pond, hidden behind a thick grove of trees. The water<br />
sparkles invitingly, and Barron's eyes light up with mischief.</p>

<p><strong>Barron:</strong><br />
(grinning) "Perfect."</p>

<p>He approaches the pond, looking around once more to ensure he's alone. With a<br />
quick glance over his shoulder, he begins to strip, tossing his clothes<br />
carelessly onto a low-hanging branch. The branch creaks under the weight, nearly<br />
snapping, but holds firm. Barron, now in nothing but his boxers, pauses and<br />
gives a little twirl.</p>

<p><strong>Barron:</strong><br />
(smirking) "Who needs a runway? I'm my own runway."</p>

<p>He then lets his boxers drop to the ground, revealing a firm, well-toned butt<br />
that could probably crack walnuts. The sight is both comical and absurd, like a<br />
cherub in a Renaissance painting gone rogue. He gives a playful wiggle and steps<br />
into the water.</p>

<p><strong>Barron:</strong><br />
(sighing contentedly) "Ahhh, finally. Some peace and quiet."</p>

<p>The water is cool and refreshing, and Barron wades deeper, until he's fully<br />
submerged. He closes his eyes and lets out a deep breath, enjoying the<br />
tranquility. Suddenly, a mischievous grin spreads across his face.</p>

<p><strong>Barron:</strong><br />
(muttering to himself) "Alright, time to relieve some tension."</p>

<p>He takes a deep breath and lets one rip. The water ripples, and a bubble trail<br />
rises to the surface, followed by a faint, but unmistakable, odor. Barron's face<br />
contorts in a mix of satisfaction and amusement.</p>

<p><strong>Barron:</strong><br />
(laughing) "Oh man, that was satisfying."</p>

<p>The fish, however, are not as amused. A few of them belly-up, floating to the<br />
surface, their eyes bulging from the awful stench. Barron notices and grins,<br />
scooping up one of the unfortunate fish.</p>

<p><strong>Barron:</strong><br />
(chuckling) "Looks like I caught dinner. Sorry, little buddy, but a guy's gotta<br />
eat."</p>

<p>He wades back to the shore, dripping wet and holding the fish triumphantly. He<br />
lays the fish on a nearby rock and starts to gather some kindling for a fire. As<br />
he works, he can't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation.</p>

<p><strong>Barron:</strong><br />
(talking to himself) "Dad would never believe this. 'Barron, you caught dinner<br />
from a pond? How ... unconventional.'"</p>

<p>The fire catches, and Barron begins to cook the fish, the scent of cooking meat<br />
mingling with the fresh scent of the garden. He sits back, looking at the pond<br />
and the White House in the distance, a contented smile on his face.</p>

<p><strong>Barron:</strong><br />
(sighing) "You know, sometimes you just gotta take a break and enjoy the little<br />
things. Even if they're a bit ... unconventional."</p>

<p>The scene fades to black, leaving Barron alone by his makeshift campfire,<br />
enjoying the simple pleasures of life in the most unconventional of settings.</p>
