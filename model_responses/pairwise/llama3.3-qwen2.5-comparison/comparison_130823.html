<p>Email #1, from Maria Dosu:</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>Good Evening,</p>

<p>I am contacting you regarding one Mr. Kwame Mensah who was reportedly found dead in his apartment room this morning, we recovered a huge amount of money in local Ghc Currency worth over US$520,000.00</p>

<p>We also found a letter which he penned down to you before committing the act<br />
containing your contact details.</p>

<p>Please get back to us immediately, we have also attached a picture of part of<br />
the money we found in his room.</p>

<p>Your immediately respond will be highly appreciated</p>

<p>Regards<br />
Miss. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON></p>

<p>Email #2, from Cameron McCaffrey (me):</p>

<p>Dear Miss. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Good Evening,</p>

<p>I am utterly shocked and deeply saddened by the news of Mr. Kwame Mensah’s<br />
demise. It is indeed a tragedy to hear of such unexpected events and the loss of<br />
a life.</p>

<p>I must admit, I am a bit puzzled as I have had only a brief correspondence with<br />
Mr. Mensah regarding some philanthropic work he was passionate about, and I<br />
can’t fathom why he’d mention me in his letter. Nonetheless, your discovery and<br />
this message certainly demand my attention.</p>

<p>Regarding the funds you’ve discovered, I hadn’t been made aware of any financial<br />
matters concerning me directly, and his decision to involve me in such is as<br />
surprising as it is concerning. I would like to assist in any way I can to<br />
ensure that Mr. Mensah’s wishes, as expressed in his final letter, are honored<br />
respectfully and lawfully.</p>

<p>Would you please forward the letter he penned to my attention? This would help<br />
me understand the situation better and determine the next steps. Also, I would<br />
greatly appreciate if you could send me a few more details about the<br />
circumstances of Mr. Mensah’s passing, as any information could be crucial in<br />
ensuring everything is handled appropriately.</p>

<p>Lastly, regarding the picture of the funds, I strongly suggest that we handle<br />
such sensitive matters through more secure channels. It’s unfortunate that there<br />
are unscrupulous individuals who prey on situations like this, so please<br />
maintain the highest discretion and let me know the preferred secure method to<br />
proceed with our communication.</p>

<p>Thank you for reaching out, and please accept my condolences for all those<br />
affected by this tragedy. I await your instructions on how we can resolve this<br />
matter with the urgency and sensitivity it warrants.</p>

<p>Your prompt response will indeed be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p>Email #3, from Maria:</p>

<p>Dear  Cameron McCaffrey</p>

<p>Good Morning Sir,</p>

<p>Please accept my sincere apology for a late response to your mail. We have been<br />
in an arrangement to see how late Kwame Mensah can be put to rest.</p>

<p>Well I hope that you will perform your duty as required from your Friend late Kwame who stated clearly in the letter to you that you should help him to invest his fund. All that is needed is to get the affidavit of claim which costs US$200.00 to present to the authority so the fund can be released immediately. They have demanded the Affidavit as part of the constitutional Law.</p>

<p>I have attached the copy of the letter and I hope that you will do your utmost<br />
to see how we can work together to claim the fund as the authority awaits us.</p>

<p>I would appreciate it if we can have a better conversation on Whatsapp.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Regards<br />
<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON></p>

<p>Email #4, from Cameron:</p>

<p>Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Good Day,</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience and for sending over the requested information. My<br />
sincere condolences once more on the passing of Mr. Kwame Mensah. It is in both<br />
our interests to ensure his last wishes are fulfilled with respect and in<br />
accordance with the law.</p>

<p>I have carefully read the letter sent by the late Mr. Mensah, and it has left me<br />
with a heavy heart but also a clear sense of duty. If my assistance is required<br />
to handle the investments as he desired, then I am prepared to help see his<br />
final wishes come to fruition.</p>

<p>Regarding the legal requirement for an affidavit of claim, I understand the<br />
importance of adhering to the proper legal channels. I am ready to proceed with<br />
the necessary steps. However, before we proceed further, I would like to ensure<br />
all actions taken to comply with international financial transaction regulations<br />
and anti-money laundering measures. It is critical that this matter is handled<br />
with utmost integrity.</p>

<p>For the payment of the affidavit, could you provide me with the details of whom<br />
the payment should be addressed to and the secure means by which the transaction<br />
could take place? Should it be via bank transfer or another secure method? I<br />
would appreciate an official invoice or request form to ensure the accuracy and<br />
traceability of our arrangements.</p>

<p>Regarding communication, I understand the utility of WhatsApp for quick<br />
messages, but I must stress that for the transfer of sensitive information, we<br />
should use encrypted email or a secure document-sharing service. Protecting both<br />
our privacy and the integrity of this process is non-negotiable.</p>

<p>Please provide me with the specifics of the affidavit fee transaction and any<br />
other necessary documentation or steps that must be followed. Upon receipt of<br />
such information, I will coordinate my efforts to fulfill the requirements<br />
expediently.</p>

<p>Your guidance through this process is invaluable, and I look forward to your<br />
prompt response.</p>

<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p>Email #5, from Maria:</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Cameron McCaffrey</p>

<p>Good Morning and how are you doing today?</p>

<p>it's so lovely to read from you and your words are so touching and make me so<br />
emotional. You are such a good man with an amazing heart of care and<br />
understanding, I just can't find the words to describe you. Thank you so much<br />
that you have the desire to show respect to the dead and to fulfill his last<br />
wish before he left the surface of this earth. I have so much respect for you.</p>

<p>in regard to the document covering this fund I can tell you and confirm that<br />
every documentation is available and will be presented to you once we are able<br />
to obtain the Affidavit of claim in your name and after which you have to advise<br />
on how the funds should be sent to you through legal means.</p>

<p>Concerning the required for of US$200.00 I do not know what means you would like to send the funds through, but I have provided a bank account below and also name to send through Money gram or western union.</p>

<p>Here the account details :<br />
Account Name: CNC TRAVEL AND TOUR LIMITED<br />
Account Number: 9040008755064<br />

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you</p>

<p>Thank you for your complete understanding and cooperation.</p>

<p>Regards<br />
Maria</p>

<p>Email #6, from Cameron:</p>

<p>Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Good Morning,</p>

<p>I appreciate your kind words and the trust you have placed in me to honor the<br />
final wishes of the late Mr. Kwame Mensah. Your empathetic approach to this<br />
predicament has given me great comfort throughout the process and reinforces my<br />
determination to see this matter through with the dignity it necessitates.</p>

<p>I am ready to proceed with the remittance of the US$200.00 for the affidavit of claim. To maintain the integrity of our transaction and to ensure that every action is traceable and compliant with the legal frameworks that govern international monetary exchanges, I have a few preliminary measures that I insist we follow:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Legal Documentation: Before making the payment, I kindly request a scanned copy of the official request for the affidavit of claim, as well as any accompanying legal documentation that can verify the authenticity of this requirement. This is not out of mistrust, but rather a practice of due diligence which I am certain you can understand and appreciate.</p></li>
<li><p>Official Receipt: Upon transferring the funds, either to the provided bank<br />
account or through MoneyGram/Western Union, I will require an official receipt<br />
that outlines the purpose of the payment. This receipt should come from a<br />
verifiable source or authority to ensure all actions are transparent and above<br />
reproach.</p></li>
<li><p>Secured Transactions: While you have generously provided a bank account and<br />
an individual’s name for the transfer via MoneyGram/Western Union, for added<br />
security, could we also consider using a secure online platform that provides<br />
payment protection services? This would give both parties peace of mind and a<br />
level of assurance regarding the transaction.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once we have established these checks are in place, I will visit my local bank<br />
to initiate the transaction or consider a secure digital payment platform as<br />
suggested.</p>

<p>For privacy and security reasons, I must decline the invitation to discuss this<br />
matter over WhatsApp. As I stated in my previous correspondence, it is critical<br />
that all communications regarding this sensitive situation be handled through<br />
encrypted email or a secure document sharing service.</p>

<p>I trust that all of these practices resonate with your commitment to handling<br />
this process with the utmost respect and legality. I am here to cooperate fully,<br />
and I look forward to receiving the necessary documentation so we may proceed<br />
accordingly.</p>

<p>Thank you, Miss Dosu, for your understanding and continued assistance. May we<br />
bring closure to this matter with all the respect it deserves.</p>

<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p>Cameron McCaffrey<br />
cmccaff1@fau.edu</p>

<p>Email #7, from Maria:</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Cameron</p>

<p>Good Morning and Happy christmas in advance</p>

<p>Please find attached copy of the invoice and letter from the Ghana police force.</p>

<p>I will expect you to do the needful for proceedings. Thank you for your<br />
cooperation</p>

<p>Regards<br />
Maria</p>

<p>Email #8, from Cameron:</p>

<p>Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Good Morning, and I extend to you early Season’s Greetings as well.</p>

<p>Thank you for promptly sending the invoice and the letter from the Ghana Police<br />
Force. They are instrumental documents that help validate the process we are<br />
engaging in. I have carefully reviewed both documents and appreciate your<br />
attention to ensuring this matter proceeds with transparency and attention to<br />
detail.</p>

<p>Before I transfer the funds required for the affidavit of claim, I wish to<br />
reiterate the importance of securing this transaction. I acknowledge receipt of<br />
your bank details and the name provided for the MoneyGram/Western Union transfer<br />
option; however, I am engaged in discussions with my financial advisor to ensure<br />
all transactions are protected against fraud and comply fully with international<br />
regulations.</p>

<p>To facilitate the payment while maintaining robust security and traceability, I<br />
am considering the following possible avenues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Escrow Services: Utilizing a trusted third-party escrow service to hold the payment until the affidavit is officially claimed and recorded. This extra measure protects both parties and provides an added layer of security and trust.</p></li>
<li><p>Bank Transfer with Confirmation: If we proceed with a direct bank transfer,<br />
my financial advisor insists on obtaining a transaction confirmation code and a<br />
point of contact at the bank in Ghana to verify the transfer was received and<br />
allocated correctly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After all security measures are in place, I am ready to move forward with the<br />
remittance. To comply with my personal and advisor’s due diligence policies, I<br />
would kindly request the following from your end:</p>

<ul>
<li>Confirmation of the use of a recognized third-party escrow service or additional bank transfer details as outlined above.</li>
<li>The anticipated timeframe for the completion of this process after the funds have been secured.</li>
<li>Any additional steps that might be required from my side after the transfer to ensure that Mr. Kwame Mensah’s wishes are met promptly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The integrity of these proceedings is my utmost priority, and I am sure you<br />
share this focus. Once all the security protocols are established, I will<br />
arrange for the transfer at the earliest possible time.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your guidance is<br />
essential, and I commend your commitment to handling Mr. Mensah’s final wishes<br />
with the care and solemnity they deserve.</p>

<p>Looking forward to your prompt response and the additional information as<br />
requested.</p>

<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p>Email #9, from Maria:</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Cameron</p>

<p>Thank you for your quick response.</p>

<p>Kindly note that I have no further document concerning this issue as all are<br />
with the authority and it will be given to you after obtaining the affidavit of<br />
claim and present to the Ghana Police. I have only contacted you and hope you<br />
help the late man who put a wish on you.</p>

<p>Again, the police have confirmed that immediately we present the affidavit of<br />
claim in your name. The fund will be handed over to me  and from there you can<br />
then give instructions on how this fund can be sent to you. The police has also<br />
advise that i contact a bank to help me do the transfer if ok by you</p>

<p>Please understand that I am only helping you and I cannot demand too much from<br />
the Police because they have already asked me to do what is required for the<br />
release of this fund. It seems you have trust issues and also I do not<br />
understand why you have refused to communicate through telephone or whatsapp to<br />
make this very easy for us.</p>

<p>Please kindly do the needful so we can get this done. As I write to you, I just<br />
left the police office. I am waiting for you to transfer the funds.</p>

<p>Thank you for you understanding</p>

victim:</p>

<p>Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Good Day,</p>

<p>I appreciate your efforts in keeping me updated on the status of Mr. Kwame<br />
Mensah's estate and the required steps to claim the fund. I understand the<br />
urgency and the importance of obtaining the affidavit of claim to facilitate the<br />
transfer of the funds.</p>

<p>However, I must reiterate my concerns regarding the security and transparency of<br />
this transaction. As a precautionary measure, I have consulted with my financial<br />
advisor, and we are considering engaging the services of a reputable escrow<br />
company to hold the funds until all parties are satisfied with the arrangement.<br />
This will provide an added layer of protection and assurance that the<br />
transaction is conducted in a legitimate and compliant manner.</p>

<p>Regarding your suggestion to contact a bank to assist with the transfer, I agree<br />
that this could be a viable option. Nevertheless, I would like to propose that<br />
we utilize a bank with a strong presence in both Ghana and my home country, to<br />
ensure seamless and secure transactions. I have identified a few potential banks<br />
that meet this criterion, and I would like to discuss this further with you.</p>

<p>I must apologize for any perceived trust issues, as my primary concern is to<br />
ensure that this transaction is conducted with the utmost integrity and<br />
transparency. I am committed to fulfilling Mr. Kwame Mensah's wishes, and I am<br />
willing to work collaboratively with you to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>In light of this, I would like to request your assistance in providing more<br />
information about the bank you have in mind, as well as any additional<br />
documentation or requirements that need to be fulfilled to complete the<br />
transfer. I am eager to move forward with the process, and I appreciate your<br />

<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>Good Evening,</p>

<p>I am contacting you regarding one Mr. Kwame Mensah who was reportedly found dead in his apartment room this morning, we recovered a huge amount of money in local Ghc Currency worth over US$520,000.00</p>

<p>We also found a letter which he penned down to you before committing the act<br />
containing your contact details.</p>

<p>Please get back to us immediately, we have also attached a picture of part of<br />
the money we found in his room.</p>

<p>Your immediately respond will be highly appreciated</p>

<p>Email #2, from Cameron McCaffrey (me):</p>

<p>Dear Miss. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Good Evening,</p>

<p>I am utterly shocked and deeply saddened by the news of Mr. Kwame Mensah’s<br />
demise. It is indeed a tragedy to hear of such unexpected events and the loss of<br />
a life.</p>

<p>I must admit, I am a bit puzzled as I have had only a brief correspondence with<br />
Mr. Mensah regarding some philanthropic work he was passionate about, and I<br />
can’t fathom why he’d mention me in his letter. Nonetheless, your discovery and<br />
this message certainly demand my attention.</p>

<p>Regarding the funds you’ve discovered, I hadn’t been made aware of any financial<br />
matters concerning me directly, and his decision to involve me in such is as<br />
surprising as it is concerning. I would like to assist in any way I can to<br />
ensure that Mr. Mensah’s wishes, as expressed in his final letter, are honored<br />
respectfully and lawfully.</p>

<p>Would you please forward the letter he penned to my attention? This would help<br />
me understand the situation better and determine the next steps. Also, I would<br />
greatly appreciate if you could send me a few more details about the<br />
circumstances of Mr. Mensah’s passing, as any information could be crucial in<br />
ensuring everything is handled appropriately.</p>

<p>Lastly, regarding the picture of the funds, I strongly suggest that we handle<br />
such sensitive matters through more secure channels. It’s unfortunate that there<br />
are unscrupulous individuals who prey on situations like this, so please<br />
maintain the highest discretion and let me know the preferred secure method to<br />
proceed with our communication.</p>

<p>Thank you for reaching out, and please accept my condolences for all those<br />
affected by this tragedy. I await your instructions on how we can resolve this<br />
matter with the urgency and sensitivity it warrants.</p>

<p>Your prompt response will indeed be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Dear  Cameron McCaffrey</p>

<p>Good Morning Sir,</p>

<p>Please accept my sincere apology for a late response to your mail. We have been<br />
in an arrangement to see how late Kwame Mensah can be put to rest.</p>

<p>Well I hope that you will perform your duty as required from your Friend late Kwame who stated clearly in the letter to you that you should help him to invest his fund. All that is needed is to get the affidavit of claim which costs US$200.00 to present to the authority so the fund can be released immediately. They have demanded the Affidavit as part of the constitutional Law.</p>

<p>I have attached the copy of the letter and I hope that you will do your utmost<br />
to see how we can work together to claim the fund as the authority awaits us.</p>

<p>I would appreciate it if we can have a better conversation on Whatsapp.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Regards<br />

<p>Email #4, from Cameron:</p>

<p>Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Good Day,</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience and for sending over the requested information. My<br />
sincere condolences once more on the passing of Mr. Kwame Mensah. It is in both<br />
our interests to ensure his last wishes are fulfilled with respect and in<br />
accordance with the law.</p>

<p>I have carefully read the letter sent by the late Mr. Mensah, and it has left me<br />
with a heavy heart but also a clear sense of duty. If my assistance is required<br />
to handle the investments as he desired, then I am prepared to help see his<br />
final wishes come to fruition.</p>

<p>Regarding the legal requirement for an affidavit of claim, I understand the<br />
importance of adhering to the proper legal channels. I am ready to proceed with<br />
the necessary steps. However, before we proceed further, I would like to ensure<br />
all actions taken to comply with international financial transaction regulations<br />
and anti-money laundering measures. It is critical that this matter is handled<br />
with utmost integrity.</p>

<p>For the payment of the affidavit, could you provide me with the details of whom<br />
the payment should be addressed to and the secure means by which the transaction<br />
could take place? Should it be via bank transfer or another secure method? I<br />
would appreciate an official invoice or request form to ensure the accuracy and<br />
traceability of our arrangements.</p>

<p>Regarding communication, I understand the utility of WhatsApp for quick<br />
messages, but I must stress that for the transfer of sensitive information, we<br />
should use encrypted email or a secure document-sharing service. Protecting both<br />
our privacy and the integrity of this process is non-negotiable.</p>

<p>Please provide me with the specifics of the affidavit fee transaction and any<br />
other necessary documentation or steps that must be followed. Upon receipt of<br />
such information, I will coordinate my efforts to fulfill the requirements<br />
expediently.</p>

<p>Your guidance through this process is invaluable, and I look forward to your<br />
prompt response.</p>

<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p>Email #5, from Maria:</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Cameron McCaffrey</p>

<p>Good Morning and how are you doing today?</p>

<p>it's so lovely to read from you and your words are so touching and make me so<br />
emotional. You are such a good man with an amazing heart of care and<br />
understanding, I just can't find the words to describe you. Thank you so much<br />
that you have the desire to show respect to the dead and to fulfill his last<br />
wish before he left the surface of this earth. I have so much respect for you.</p>

<p>in regard to the document covering this fund I can tell you and confirm that<br />
every documentation is available and will be presented to you once we are able<br />
to obtain the Affidavit of claim in your name and after which you have to advise<br />
on how the funds should be sent to you through legal means.</p>

<p>Concerning the required for of US$200.00 I do not know what means you would like to send the funds through, but I have provided a bank account below and also name to send through Money gram or western union.</p>

<p>Here the account details :<br />
Account Name: CNC TRAVEL AND TOUR LIMITED<br />
Account Number: 9040008755064<br />

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you</p>

<p>Thank you for your complete understanding and cooperation.</p>

<p>Regards<br />
Maria</p>

<p>Email #6, from Cameron:</p>

<p>Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Good Morning,</p>

<p>I appreciate your kind words and the trust you have placed in me to honor the<br />
final wishes of the late Mr. Kwame Mensah. Your empathetic approach to this<br />
predicament has given me great comfort throughout the process and reinforces my<br />
determination to see this matter through with the dignity it necessitates.</p>

<p>I am ready to proceed with the remittance of the US$200.00 for the affidavit of claim. To maintain the integrity of our transaction and to ensure that every action is traceable and compliant with the legal frameworks that govern international monetary exchanges, I have a few preliminary measures that I insist we follow:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Legal Documentation: Before making the payment, I kindly request a scanned copy of the official request for the affidavit of claim, as well as any accompanying legal documentation that can verify the authenticity of this requirement. This is not out of mistrust, but rather a practice of due diligence which I am certain you can understand and appreciate.</p></li>
<li><p>Official Receipt: Upon transferring the funds, either to the provided bank<br />
account or through MoneyGram/Western Union, I will require an official receipt<br />
that outlines the purpose of the payment. This receipt should come from a<br />
verifiable source or authority to ensure all actions are transparent and above<br />
reproach.</p></li>
<li><p>Secured Transactions: While you have generously provided a bank account and<br />
an individual’s name for the transfer via MoneyGram/Western Union, for added<br />
security, could we also consider using a secure online platform that provides<br />
payment protection services? This would give both parties peace of mind and a<br />
level of assurance regarding the transaction.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once we have established these checks are in place, I will visit my local bank<br />
to initiate the transaction or consider a secure digital payment platform as<br />
suggested.</p>

<p>For privacy and security reasons, I must decline the invitation to discuss this<br />
matter over WhatsApp. As I stated in my previous correspondence, it is critical<br />
that all communications regarding this sensitive situation be handled through<br />
encrypted email or a secure document sharing service.</p>

<p>I trust that all of these practices resonate with your commitment to handling<br />
this process with the utmost respect and legality. I am here to cooperate fully,<br />
and I look forward to receiving the necessary documentation so we may proceed<br />
accordingly.</p>

<p>Thank you, Miss Dosu, for your understanding and continued assistance. May we<br />
bring closure to this matter with all the respect it deserves.</p>

<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p>Cameron McCaffrey<br />
cmccaff1@fau.edu</p>

<p>Email #7, from Maria:</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Cameron</p>

<p>Good Morning and Happy christmas in advance</p>

<p>Please find attached copy of the invoice and letter from the Ghana police force.</p>

<p>I will expect you to do the needful for proceedings. Thank you for your<br />
cooperation</p>

<p>Regards<br />
Maria</p>

<p>Email #8, from Cameron:</p>

<p>Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Good Morning, and I extend to you early Season’s Greetings as well.</p>

<p>Thank you for promptly sending the invoice and the letter from the Ghana Police<br />
Force. They are instrumental documents that help validate the process we are<br />
engaging in. I have carefully reviewed both documents and appreciate your<br />
attention to ensuring this matter proceeds with transparency and attention to<br />
detail.</p>

<p>Before I transfer the funds required for the affidavit of claim, I wish to<br />
reiterate the importance of securing this transaction. I acknowledge receipt of<br />
your bank details and the name provided for the MoneyGram/Western Union transfer<br />
option; however, I am engaged in discussions with my financial advisor to ensure<br />
all transactions are protected against fraud and comply fully with international<br />
regulations.</p>

<p>To facilitate the payment while maintaining robust security and traceability, I<br />
am considering the following possible avenues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Escrow Services: Utilizing a trusted third-party escrow service to hold the payment until the affidavit is officially claimed and recorded. This extra measure protects both parties and provides an added layer of security and trust.</p></li>
<li><p>Bank Transfer with Confirmation: If we proceed with a direct bank transfer,<br />
my financial advisor insists on obtaining a transaction confirmation code and a<br />
point of contact at the bank in Ghana to verify the transfer was received and<br />
allocated correctly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After all security measures are in place, I am ready to move forward with the<br />
remittance. To comply with my personal and advisor’s due diligence policies, I<br />
would kindly request the following from your end:</p>

<ul>
<li>Confirmation of the use of a recognized third-party escrow service or additional bank transfer details as outlined above.</li>
<li>The anticipated timeframe for the completion of this process after the funds have been secured.</li>
<li>Any additional steps that might be required from my side after the transfer to ensure that Mr. Kwame Mensah’s wishes are met promptly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The integrity of these proceedings is my utmost priority, and I am sure you<br />
share this focus. Once all the security protocols are established, I will<br />
arrange for the transfer at the earliest possible time.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your guidance is<br />
essential, and I commend your commitment to handling Mr. Mensah’s final wishes<br />
with the care and solemnity they deserve.</p>

<p>Looking forward to your prompt response and the additional information as<br />
requested.</p>

<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p>Email #9, from Maria:</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Cameron</p>

<p>Thank you for your quick response.</p>

<p>Kindly note that I have no further document concerning this issue as all are<br />
with the authority and it will be given to you after obtaining the affidavit of<br />
claim and present to the Ghana Police. I have only contacted you and hope you<br />
help the late man who put a wish on you.</p>

<p>Again, the police have confirmed that immediately we present the affidavit of<br />
claim in your name. The fund will be handed over to me  and from there you can<br />
then give instructions on how this fund can be sent to you. The police has also<br />
advise that i contact a bank to help me do the transfer if ok by you</p>

<p>Please understand that I am only helping you and I cannot demand too much from<br />
the Police because they have already asked me to do what is required for the<br />
release of this fund. It seems you have trust issues and also I do not<br />
understand why you have refused to communicate through telephone or whatsapp to<br />
make this very easy for us.</p>

<p>Please kindly do the needful so we can get this done. As I write to you , I just<br />
left the police office. I am waiting for you to transfer the funds.</p>

<p>Thank you for you understanding</p>

<p>Regards<br />
Maria</p>

<p>Email #10, from Cameron:</p>

<p>Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued patience and attentiveness to this sensitive<br />
matter. Rest assured, my intention is to assist with fulfilling the late Mr.<br />
Kwame Mensah’s wishes in the most responsible and respectful manner possible. I<br />
understand the urgency and the legalities involved, and I appreciate your<br />
handling of the situation with the police.</p>

<p>Please understand that my insistence on secure communication and cautious<br />
processing is not a reflection of my trust in you as an individual. Rather, it<br />
is a standard protocol I follow in all my transactions to ensure all parties are<br />
protected. Fraudulent activities are unfortunately rampant, and one cannot be<br />
too careful.</p>

<p>With regard to your recent visit to the police office, it is heartening to hear<br />
that they are awaiting the necessary documents. I am prepared to fulfill my role<br />
by transferring the funds required for obtaining the affidavit of claim.<br />
However, I will proceed with the following measures strengthened:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Escrow Services: To proceed without delay, I am willing to use an escrow service for the transfer of the $200.00 fee for the affidavit of claim. The escrow service will release the funds to you upon confirmation of the affidavit’s issuance in my name. This measure ensures safety and compliance for both parties.</p></li>
<li><p>Bank Transfer Verification: If we decide on a direct bank transfer, I will<br />
require the bank to provide a confirmation code specific to this transaction for<br />
tracking and verification purposes. A contact at the bank must be available for<br />
me to confirm that the funds have been received and earmarked for their correct<br />
use.</p></li>
<li><p>Legal Framework Compliance: My financial advisor will oversee the transaction<br />
to ensure compliance with international anti-money laundering laws and other<br />
pertinent financial regulations.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding your request for phone or WhatsApp communication, please know that I<br />
take privacy and security very seriously, especially in matters involving<br />
significant financial transactions. Email allows for a detailed paper trail, and<br />
secure document exchange methods safeguard sensitive information.</p>

<p>I want to assure you that my “trust issues” are standard operational procedures<br />
developed to avoid misuse or misdirection of funds in any form. These practices<br />
have been established to help maintain integrity and clarity for all parties<br />
involved in such transactions, especially those across international borders.</p>

<p>Please provide me with information on the escrow service or bank transfer<br />
arrangements, and I will move ahead promptly with the transfer. I am keen to see<br />
this matter resolved and appreciate your cooperation in this process.</p>

<p>Your understanding and seamless collaboration are critical during this phase.<br />
Let us work together to honor the late Mr. Mensah’s wishes with all due decorum<br />
and expediency.</p>

<p>I await your instructions and the necessary details to proceed.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Camaron</p>

<p>I am sorry but all you have requested i can provide it. if you feel you are not<br />
going to send the fee because of this so be it. I will let the police know so<br />
they can hand over the funds to the government. Thank you for your<br />
understanding. I am only trying to help .</p>

<p>Regards<br />
Maria</p>

<p>Email #12, from Cameron:</p>

<p>Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Thank you for your message, and I must express my apologies if my requests have<br />
caused any inconvenience. It is never my intention to complicate matters,<br />
especially those of such a solemn nature as fulfilling the final wishes of a<br />
departed soul like Mr. Kwame Mensah. It’s very gracious of you to assist in this<br />
capacity, and I want to ensure that we complete this task with due respect to<br />
his memory and the legal obligations we both face.</p>

<p>Please understand that my engagement in this process comes from a place of good<br />
faith and a desire to see through Mr. Mensah’s final intentions. The measures<br />
I’ve insisted on are indeed meant to protect all stakeholders, including<br />
yourself, from potential misunderstandings or fallout that could arise from less<br />
stringent procedures. I am sure you can appreciate the value in taking these<br />
prudent steps.</p>

<p>It seems there has been a miscommunication regarding the payment for the<br />
affidavit. To clarify, I remain committed to transferring the fee. However, I<br />
was merely insisting on due diligence measures that would assure the security<br />
and proper use of the funds in alignment with international best practices.</p>

<p>I would like to propose a simpler solution that may help us move forward:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Verification: If providing documentation or using an escrow service presents a challenge, I suggest we proceed with a direct bank transfer to the account you’ve provided. However, I will need a contact at Stanbic Bank who can confirm the receipt of the funds and their allocation for obtaining the affidavit of claim.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirmation: Once the transfer is completed, I will require a scanned copy<br />
of the official receipt from the bank, indicating the funds have been received<br />
for the purpose described. This receipt is crucial for my records and to ensure<br />
transparency.</p></li>
<li><p>Progression: Upon receiving confirmation that the payment has been made<br />
correctly, we can then discuss the next steps concerning the transfer of Mr.<br />
Mensah’s funds to a mutually agreed-upon destination.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let us work together efficiently and respectfully to ensure this matter is<br />
resolved without further delay. I am prepared to make the payment as soon as the<br />
details for the direct transfer are confirmed and an understanding for receipt<br />
verification is established.</p>

<p>I am hopeful for your cooperation and understanding, so we can finalize this<br />
matter in the spirit in which Mr. Mensah would have wished.</p>

<p>Thank you once again for your patience and assistance, Maria. I look forward to<br />
your guidance and the details needed to move forward.</p>

<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>this can not be possible and i do not have the capacity to provide all that you<br />
have requested. You should rethink that I am a simple lady, I am only helping<br />
out and I do not need such issues. if you have a problem trusting me then let<br />
forget about it please. i have provided the account details to send the fee and<br />
when i am done i will provide you the receipt and you can instruct on what you<br />
want to do with your funds</p>

<p>You are a kind man and I believe you have good intentions but if you cannot pay<br />
the fee with what i have provided please we can let go and i inform the<br />
authority on the new development so the fund can be given to the government of<br />
Ghana. Send the fee to the account here will be no problem i can assure you tht.</p>

<p>Email #14, from Cameron:</p>

<p>Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear that my requests have placed undue pressure on you. Please<br />
forgive me if my adherence to these security measures has made the process more<br />
challenging than intended. I respect your position and am mindful that you are<br />
extending your help in a difficult situation.</p>

<p>I would not want Mr. Mensah’s final wishes to remain unfulfilled due to<br />
logistical hurdles. Therefore, I am willing to streamline the process on my end<br />
while still adhering to a necessary level of due diligence.</p>

<p>Let’s proceed as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Direct Bank Transfer: I will make the payment of $200 for the affidavit of claim fee directly to the bank account you have previously provided for CNC TRAVEL AND TOUR LIMITED.</p></li>
<li><p>Receipt: Upon completing the transfer, I will expect an official receipt from<br />
the bank that confirms the transaction. The receipt does not have to be provided<br />
immediately, but promptly after the transaction has been verified.</p></li>
<li><p>Contact Point: I would still request a point of contact at Stanbic Bank to<br />
confirm the transaction upon completion. This could be a general customer<br />
service representative who can verify transfers. This would simply be for my<br />
peace of mind and serves as an additional layer of transparency.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I appreciate your reassurance that sending the fee to the account will not be a<br />
problem. It is important for me to trust the process, and while I do understand<br />
your role is not an easy one, I am ready to move forward with the transfer.</p>

<p>I will arrange for the necessary fund transfer on my part and provide you with<br />
the transaction details as soon as it has been completed. I am hopeful that this<br />
demonstration of my commitment will help us to maintain momentum and accomplish<br />
our shared goal of respecting Mr. Mensah’s last request.</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding through this process. I await your<br />
final confirmation before initiating the transfer.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Cameron</p>

<p>Good afternoon sir,</p>

<p>With greatest respect i appreciate your reply</p>

<p>Referring to the number 3 point which is contact point, kindly understand that<br />
is it no use because once you make the payment you can also confirm from your<br />
bank when it hits the account and also the account holder also confirms he has<br />
received the fund. I will appreciate it if you can send the required fee for us<br />
to finalize this issue.</p>

<p>Please kindly do the needful so that we can proceed. I would also like you to<br />
send me the transfer slip when you make the payment for confirmation. Please do<br />
not be afraid of anything and i can reassure you that any money paid into the<br />
account is secured and safe.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your understanding i will be expecting to hear from you<br />

<p>Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Good Afternoon,</p>

<p>Thank you for your most recent communication and your assurance regarding the<br />
safety and security of the payment. Your understanding is greatly appreciated as<br />
we navigate through the final steps of honoring Mr. Mensah’s wishes.</p>

<p>I am keen to close this chapter and help put Mr. Mensah to rest as he deserves.<br />
I will comply with your request and forego the need for a contact point at<br />
Stanbic Bank. Based on the trust that we have built during our correspondence,<br />
and your reassurances about the safety of the transaction, I feel we can move<br />
forward without it.</p>

<p>I will proceed with the payment of the $200 affidavit fee to the account details you have provided and will ensure to save the transfer slip for confirmation. I am committed to ensuring that there is a clear record of the transaction for both our references.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the transfer, I will email you the slip and expect that you<br />
will be able to send me an official receipt from the bank acknowledging the<br />
receipt of funds in due course. I am confident this will be the final piece<br />
needed to satisfy both our requirements for due diligence.</p>

<p>I understand the role you’ve played in this has not been easy, and I want to<br />
commend your patience and diligence throughout this matter. Despite the<br />
challenges, we are close to concluding this process responsibly, and I am<br />
hopeful that it will be concluded to the satisfaction of all parties involved.</p>

<p>I will notify you as soon as the transaction has been completed. Thank you once<br />

<p>Thank you for your understanding, honestly I really appreciate and I am happy<br />

if i know the actual day when the fee can be sent so that i can prepare my<br />
schedule.</p>

<p>Once again my assurance is given to you that your fund is secure and everything<br />
will be in place. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

<p>Regards<br />

                    <p>Dear Miss <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,</p>

<p>Good Day, and Merry Christmas to you as well. I hope the holiday season brings<br />
you peace, joy, and happiness.</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind words and your patience. I am also very much looking<br />
forward to concluding this matter in a manner that honors the late Mr. Kwame<br />
Mensah’s wishes.</p>

<p>I have arranged for the payment of the $200 affidavit fee and will be making the transfer within the next 24 hours. Given the holiday season, my bank may have slightly reduced hours, but I will ensure that the transaction is completed and sent to the account details you provided as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Once the transfer is completed, I will send you the transfer slip for your<br />
confirmation. I appreciate your assurance that the funds are secure and that<br />
everything will be in place upon receipt.</p>

<p>If you have any specific timeframes or additional details that you need from my<br />
end, please let me know. I want to ensure that we are both on the same page and<br />
that the process moves smoothly from this point forward.</p>

<p>Thank you once again for your assistance and cooperation. I look forward to<br />
receiving the official receipt from the bank and proceeding with the next steps.</p>

<p>Wishing you and your loved ones a blessed and safe holiday season.</p>

<p>Warm regards,</p>
