                    <p>What a fascinating comparison! Let's dive into the evolution of Amazon's website<br />
between 1995 and 1997.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon in 1995:</strong><br />
In July 1995, Amazon launched as an online bookstore with a simple website. The<br />
site was created by Jeff Bezos, and it was initially called Cadabra, Inc. (later<br />
changed to Amazon.com, Inc.). The website had a basic design, with a focus on<br />
functionality rather than aesthetics. Some notable features of Amazon's 1995<br />
website include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A plain, text-based interface with a blue background</li>
<li>A simple search bar and basic navigation</li>
<li>A limited selection of books (around 90,000 titles)</li>
<li>No images or graphics, except for a small Amazon logo</li>
<li>A "1-Click Ordering" system, which allowed customers to store their shipping and payment information for future purchases</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Amazon in 1997:</strong><br />
By 1997, Amazon had expanded its product offerings beyond books to include CDs,<br />
videos, and software. The website underwent significant changes to accommodate<br />
the growing product catalog and improving technology. Some notable features of<br />
Amazon's 1997 website include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A more modern design with a white background and a larger, more prominent logo</li>
<li>Improved navigation, including a category-based menu and a "Browse" section</li>
<li>The introduction of images and graphics, such as product thumbnails and icons</li>
<li>A "Recommendations" feature, which suggested products based on customers' browsing and purchasing history</li>
<li>An expanded product selection, with over 1 million items in stock</li>
<li>The launch of Amazon's associates program, which allowed website owners to earn commissions by promoting Amazon products</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key differences:</strong><br />
Comparing the two websites, we can see significant improvements in design,<br />
functionality, and features between 1995 and 1997. Some key differences include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Design:</strong> The 1997 website has a more modern and visually appealing design, with a cleaner layout and more graphics.</li>
<li><strong>Navigation:</strong> The 1997 website has improved navigation, making it easier for customers to find what they're looking for.</li>
<li><strong>Product selection:</strong> The 1997 website offers a much broader selection of products, with over 1 million items in stock.</li>
<li><strong>Personalization:</strong> The 1997 website introduces personalized recommendations, which would become a hallmark of Amazon's customer experience.</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships:</strong> The 1997 website launches the associates program, which would help Amazon expand its reach and build a network of partners.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the evolution of Amazon's website between 1995 and 1997 reflects the<br />
company's rapid growth, improving technology, and increasing focus on customer<br />
experience.</p>
