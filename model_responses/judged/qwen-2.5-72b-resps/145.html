                <p>The reaction between solid calcium carbonate (CaCO‚ÇÉ) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a classic example of an acid-base reaction, specifically a neutralization reaction where an acid reacts with a carbonate to produce a salt, carbon dioxide, and water. Here‚Äôs a detailed description of the process and the balanced chemical equation:</p>

<h3>Process:</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Initial Contact</strong>: When solid calcium carbonate (CaCO‚ÇÉ) comes into contact with hydrochloric acid (HCl), the acid begins to dissolve the carbonate.</li>
<li><strong>Reaction Initiation</strong>: The H‚Å∫ ions from the HCl react with the CO‚ÇÉ¬≤‚Åª ions from the CaCO‚ÇÉ, leading to the formation of carbonic acid (H‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ).</li>
<li><strong>Decomposition of Carbonic Acid</strong>: The carbonic acid (H‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ) is unstable and quickly decomposes into carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) gas and water (H‚ÇÇO).</li>
<li><strong>Formation of Calcium Chloride</strong>: The remaining Ca¬≤‚Å∫ ions from the CaCO‚ÇÉ combine with the Cl‚Åª ions from the HCl to form aqueous calcium chloride (CaCl‚ÇÇ).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Balanced Chemical Equation:</h3>

<p>[ \text{CaCO}<em>3(s) + 2\text{HCl}(aq) \rightarrow \text{CaCl}</em>2(aq) + \text{CO}<em>2(g) + \text{H}</em>2\text{O}(l) ]</p>

<h3>Type of Reaction:</h3>

<p>This is a <strong>neutralization reaction</strong> involving a carbonate and an acid. It can also be classified as a <strong>gas evolution reaction</strong> because one of the products is a gas (CO‚ÇÇ).</p>

<h3>Observations:</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Bubbling or Effervescence</strong>: The most noticeable observation is the production of bubbles or effervescence as carbon dioxide gas is released. This is often seen as fizzing or bubbling in the solution.</li>
<li><strong>Temperature Change</strong>: The reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. Therefore, the temperature of the solution may increase slightly.</li>
<li><strong>Dissolution of Solid</strong>: The solid calcium carbonate will gradually dissolve as the reaction proceeds, leading to a decrease in the amount of solid present.</li>
<li><strong>Color Change</strong>: If an indicator such as phenolphthalein is added, it may change color due to the pH changes during the reaction. However, this is not typically observed in a simple demonstration without indicators.</li>
</ol>

<p>These observations collectively indicate that the reaction between calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid is occurring.</p>
