                <p>When a satellite in a circular orbit around the Earth experiences a decrease in its speed, several changes occur due to the principles of orbital mechanics. Let's analyze this step-by-step:</p>

<h3>1. <strong>Orbital Mechanics Basics:</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Kepler's Laws:</strong> These laws describe the motion of planets and satellites. For a circular orbit, the satellite's speed ( v ) is given by:
[
v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}
]
where ( G ) is the gravitational constant, ( M ) is the mass of the Earth, and ( r ) is the orbital radius.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Centripetal Force:</strong> The centripetal force required to keep the satellite in orbit is provided by the gravitational force:
[
\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{GMm}{r^2}
]
Simplifying, we get:
[
v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}
]</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>2. <strong>Effect of Decreased Speed:</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>If the speed ( v ) decreases, the right-hand side of the equation ( v^2 = \frac{GM}{r} ) must also decrease to maintain equilibrium. This implies that the orbital radius ( r ) must increase to balance the equation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. <strong>Energy Considerations:</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>The total mechanical energy ( E ) of the satellite in a circular orbit is the sum of its kinetic energy ( K ) and potential energy ( U ):
[
E = K + U = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}
]</li>
<li>For a circular orbit, the total energy is:
[
E = -\frac{GMm}{2r}
]</li>
<li>If the speed decreases, the kinetic energy ( K ) decreases. To conserve energy, the potential energy ( U ) must also change. Since the potential energy is negative and becomes less negative (i.e., more positive), the satellite moves to a higher orbit where the potential energy is less negative.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. <strong>Orbital Radius Increase:</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>As the satellite slows down, it no longer has enough kinetic energy to maintain its original circular orbit. It starts to move into an elliptical orbit with a higher apogee (farthest point from the Earth). Over time, if the speed remains lower, the satellite will settle into a new circular orbit at a higher altitude.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. <strong>Period of Revolution:</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>The period ( T ) of a satellite in a circular orbit is given by Kepler's third law:
[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}}
]</li>
<li>As the orbital radius ( r ) increases, the period ( T ) also increases because the satellite has to travel a longer distance in its orbit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Orbital Radius:</strong> The orbital radius of the satellite will increase.</li>
<li><strong>Period of Revolution:</strong> The period of revolution of the satellite will increase.</li>
</ul>

<p>These changes are consistent with the principles of conservation of energy and the relationship between orbital speed, radius, and period as described by Kepler's laws and Newtonian mechanics.</p>
