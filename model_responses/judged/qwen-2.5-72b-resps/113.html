                <p>In a survey conducted at a local high school, preferences for a new school color were measured: 58% of students liked the color blue, 45% preferred green, and 22% liked both colors. If we randomly pick a student from the school, what's the probability that they would like neither blue nor green?</p>

<p>[The Start of Reference Answer]
To find the probability that a student likes neither blue nor green, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:</p>

<p>P(A ‚à™ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ‚à© B)</p>

<p>In this case, A represents the event of liking blue, B represents the event of liking green, and A ‚à© B represents the event of liking both colors.</p>

<p>P(A) = 58% (probability of liking blue)
P(B) = 45% (probability of liking green)
P(A ‚à© B) = 22% (probability of liking both colors)</p>

<p>Now, we can plug these values into the formula:</p>

<p>P(A ‚à™ B) = 58% + 45% - 22% = 81%</p>

<p>This gives us the probability that a student likes either blue or green. To find the probability that a student likes neither color, we can subtract this value from 100%:</p>

<p>P(neither blue nor green) = 100% - 81% = 19%</p>

<p>So, the probability that a randomly picked student would like neither blue nor green is 19%.

                <p>To find the probability that a randomly picked student likes neither blue nor green, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.</p>

<p>Let's define:
- ( P(B) ) as the probability that a student likes blue.
- ( P(G) ) as the probability that a student likes green.
- ( P(B \cap G) ) as the probability that a student likes both blue and green.</p>

<p>From the problem, we have:
- ( P(B) = 0.58 )
- ( P(G) = 0.45 )
- ( P(B \cap G) = 0.22 )</p>

<p>We need to find the probability that a student likes either blue or green (or both), which is given by:
[ P(B \cup G) = P(B) + P(G) - P(B \cap G) ]</p>

<p>Substituting the given values:
[ P(B \cup G) = 0.58 + 0.45 - 0.22 = 0.81 ]</p>

<p>This means that 81% of the students like either blue, green, or both.</p>

<p>The probability that a student likes neither blue nor green is the complement of ( P(B \cup G) ):
[ P(\text{neither}) = 1 - P(B \cup G) ]
[ P(\text{neither}) = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19 ]</p>

<p>So, the probability that a randomly picked student likes neither blue nor green is ( 0.19 ) or 19%.</p>

                <p>The assistant's answer is largely correct and follows a logical structure similar to the reference answer. It correctly defines the events and uses the principle of inclusion and exclusion to calculate the probability that a student likes either blue or green. The calculations are accurate, and the final result is consistent with the reference answer.</p>

<p>Here are the key points of comparison:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Definitions</strong>: The assistant clearly defines the probabilities for liking blue, green, and both colors, which is helpful for understanding the problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calculation</strong>: The assistant correctly applies the formula for the union of two events:
[
P(B \cup G) = P(B) + P(G) - P(B \cap G)
]
The calculations are accurate:
[
P(B \cup G) = 0.58 + 0.45 - 0.22 = 0.81
]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complement Calculation</strong>: The assistant correctly calculates the probability of liking neither color as:
[
P(\text{neither}) = 1 - P(B \cup G) = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19
]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Final Result</strong>: The assistant concludes with the correct probability of 0.19 or 19%, which matches the reference answer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, the assistant's response is correct, clear, and helpful. It provides a thorough explanation of the steps taken to arrive at the answer, making it easy for the reader to follow.</p>
