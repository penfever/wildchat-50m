                <p>You are given two sorted lists of size m and n. Implement a function to find the kth smallest element in the union of the two lists with linear complexity.</p>

<p>[The Start of Reference Answer]
To find the kth smallest element in the union of two sorted lists with linear complexity, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a Python function that implements this approach:</p>

<p>```python
def find<em>kth</em>smallest(arr1, arr2, k):
    m, n = len(arr1), len(arr2)
    i, j = 0, 0</p>

<pre><code>while i &lt; m and j &lt; n:
    if arr1[i] &lt; arr2[j]:
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            return arr1[i]
        i += 1
    else:
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            return arr2[j]
        j += 1

while i &lt; m:
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        return arr1[i]
    i += 1

while j &lt; n:
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        return arr2[j]
    j += 1

return None
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This function takes two sorted lists <code>arr1</code> and <code>arr2</code>, and an integer <code>k</code> as input. It initializes two pointers <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> to traverse the two lists. The function iterates through both lists, comparing the elements at the current positions of the pointers. If the element in <code>arr1</code> is smaller, it increments the pointer <code>i</code>. If the element in <code>arr2</code> is smaller, it increments the pointer <code>j</code>. In each iteration, the function also decrements the value of <code>k</code>. When <code>k</code> reaches 0, the function returns the current element.</p>

<p>If one of the lists is exhausted, the function continues iterating through the remaining list until <code>k</code> reaches 0.</p>

<p>The time complexity of this function is O(m + n), which is linear in the size of the input lists.

                <p>To solve the problem of finding the kth smallest element in the union of two sorted lists, we can use a two-pointer technique. This approach ensures that we achieve linear time complexity, O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the two lists.</p>

<p>Here's a step-by-step implementation in Python:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Initialize Pointers</strong>: Start with two pointers, one for each list, both initially set to the start of their respective lists.</li>
<li><strong>Iterate Through Lists</strong>: Move through the lists, comparing the elements at the current positions of the pointers. Advance the pointer that points to the smaller element.</li>
<li><strong>Count Elements</strong>: Keep a count of how many elements have been considered. When this count reaches k, the current element is the kth smallest element.</li>
<li><strong>Handle Edge Cases</strong>: Ensure that you handle cases where one list is exhausted before reaching k elements.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's the Python code implementing this logic:</p>

<p>```python
def find<em>kth</em>smallest(list1, list2, k):
    m = len(list1)
    n = len(list2)
    i, j = 0, 0
    count = 0</p>

<pre><code>while i &lt; m and j &lt; n:
    if list1[i] &lt; list2[j]:
        # If the current element from list1 is smaller, increment the pointer for list1
        count += 1
        if count == k:
            return list1[i]
        i += 1
    else:
        # If the current element from list2 is smaller or equal, increment the pointer for list2
        count += 1
        if count == k:
            return list2[j]
        j += 1

# If one of the lists is exhausted, continue with the other list
while i &lt; m:
    count += 1
    if count == k:
        return list1[i]
    i += 1

while j &lt; n:
    count += 1
    if count == k:
        return list2[j]
    j += 1
</code></pre>

<h1>Example usage:</h1>

<p>list1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]
list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]
k = 5
print(find<em>kth</em>smallest(list1, list2, k))  # Output: 5
```</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Initialization</strong>: <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are initialized to 0, pointing to the start of <code>list1</code> and <code>list2</code>, respectively. <code>count</code> is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of elements considered.</li>
<li><strong>Main Loop</strong>: The loop continues as long as both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists. In each iteration, the smaller of the two current elements is chosen, and the corresponding pointer is incremented. If the <code>count</code> reaches <code>k</code>, the current element is returned.</li>
<li><strong>Exhausted List Handling</strong>: If one list is exhausted before reaching <code>k</code> elements, the remaining elements from the other list are considered. The loop continues until the <code>count</code> reaches <code>k</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach ensures that we efficiently find the kth smallest element in the union of the two sorted lists with linear time complexity.</p>
