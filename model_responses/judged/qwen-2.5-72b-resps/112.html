                <p>A tech startup invests $8000 in software development in the first year, and then invests half of that amount in software development in the second year.
What's the total amount the startup invested in software development over the two years?</p>

<p>[The Start of Reference Answer]
In the first year, the startup invested $8000. In the second year, they invested half of that amount, which is $8000 / 2 = $4000. The total amount invested in software development over the two years is $8000 + $4000 = $12000.

                <p>To find the total amount the startup invested in software development over the two years, we need to add the investments from each year.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>First Year Investment:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The startup invests $8000 in software development.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Second Year Investment:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The startup invests half of the first year's investment.</li>
<li>Half of $8000 is calculated as:
[
\frac{8000}{2} = 4000
]</li>
<li>So, the second year investment is $4000.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Total Investment Over Two Years:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Add the first year's investment and the second year's investment:
[
8000 + 4000 = 12000
]</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, the total amount the startup invested in software development over the two years is <strong>$12,000</strong>.</p>

                <p>The assistant's answer is well-structured and provides a clear breakdown of the calculations involved in determining the total investment over the two years. It correctly identifies the investments made in each year and accurately calculates the total amount invested.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>First Year Investment:</strong> The assistant correctly states that the startup invested $8000 in the first year.</li>
<li><strong>Second Year Investment:</strong> The assistant correctly calculates half of the first year's investment as $4000.</li>
<li><strong>Total Investment Calculation:</strong> The assistant correctly adds the two amounts ($8000 + $4000) to arrive at the total of $12000.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reference answer and the assistant's answer both arrive at the same conclusion and provide the same calculations. The assistant's answer is slightly more detailed, providing a step-by-step breakdown, which enhances clarity and understanding.</p>

<p>There are no mistakes in the assistant's answer, and it is both correct and helpful.</p>
